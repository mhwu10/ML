# Train CNN model for image rocognition


MNIST:
The dataset in this project is from MNIST database.
Train a CNN model by the dataset using pytorch.
There are 2 convolutional layers and 1 linear ReLu layer in the model.
The validation accuracy is slightly lower than training accuracy, but more or less the same.

CIFAR10:
The model is similar to the MNIST model.
Train the model with CIFAR10 database to recognise images of 10 classes:
airplane										
automobile										
bird										
cat										
deer										
dog										
frog										
horse										
ship										
truck

Cat dog:
The training and testing data of this project is from a kaggle competetion https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats.
The goal of this project is to correctly recognise pictures of dogs and cats.
Two models are trained for the task: (1) my model (2) pretrained AlexNet model.
